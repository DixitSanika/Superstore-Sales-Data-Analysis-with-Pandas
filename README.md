# Superstore-Sales-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas

# Dataset Overview:
This project uses the Superstore Sales dataset, which contains order records from a retail company. It includes details like order date, ship date, customer info, region, product category, and sales data.

# Before Cleaning:
- Rows: 9800
- Columns: 18 

# Data Cleaning:
We performed basic cleaning operations using Python and Pandas:
- Removed unnecessary columns like Row ID, Customer ID, Country, Postal Code, Product ID and Product Name
- Reduced the dataset from 18 columns to 12 columns
- Saved the cleaned version as: cleaned_superstore_data.csv

# Tools Used:
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab 

# Project Goal:
The main goal was to practice data cleaning using Pandas on a real-world dataset.  
This project helped improve my skills in:
- Column filtering
- Saving clean datasets
- Preparing data for analysis or visualization

Project Completed and ready for use in future analysis!
